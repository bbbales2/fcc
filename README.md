The three ways you might want to run this program are:

python test.py

This just plots 3 overlaid FCC lattices. There are positions in this lattice for all the states we want to represent. It's generated by just seeing that if we have three lattices misaligned with respect to each other then there's enough spaces to represent any sorta growth process we want.

If we only have one lattice we can only put an A atom in the A layer and a B atom in the B layer:

ABCABCABC

But if we keep track of three separate lattices we can put things wherever we need:

ABCABCABC
CABCABCAB
BCABCABCA

We just generate this by building three FCC lattices and offsetting the second 1/sqrt(3) from the first in the 111 direction and the third 2/sqrt(3) from the first in the 111 direction.

The other things to plot are:

python test.py cut

This just shows the lattice with a cut along the 111 direction.

Also:

python test.py radius

This shows all the lattice points within a radius of 1 of the center (0.0, 0.0, 0.0).
